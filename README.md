### Project Title
Explore Us Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, Python code has been written to import US bike share data and answer interesting questions about it by calculating descriptive statistics. A script has also been written that takes raw input to create an interactive in-device experience to present these statistics.

### Bike Share Data
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Statistics Computed

#### 1.Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#### 2.Popular stations and trip

- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#### 3.Trip duration

- total travel time
- average travel time

#### 4.User info

- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
